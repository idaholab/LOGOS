\section{Introduction}

\textbf{\textit{LOGOS}} is a stand-alone software package that contains a set of discrete
optimization models employable for capital budgeting optimization
problems, and \textbf{\textit{LOGOS}} integrates economic and reliability risk into a single
analysis framework. More specifically,  given system, structure and component
(SSC) health (e.g., failure rate or probability), O\&M costs, replacement costs, and cost
associated with component failure and budget constraints, \textbf{\textit{LOGOS}} provides the optimal set
of projects (e.g., SSC replacement) to maximize profit and satisfy the provided requirements.
The aforementioned input data can be either deterministic or stochastic in nature
(i.e., they can be point values or probability distribution functions). In the latter case,
several scenarios are generated by sampling the provided distributions.

\textbf{\textit{LOGOS}} can be also used as RAVEN plugin that has been developed to be linked
to RAVEN at run-time, using RAVEN APIs to perform parametric studies and plants
asset management optimizations.

This document is aimed to report the traceability matrix between software requirements
(see SRS) and requirement tests (tests that testify the software is compliant
with respect its own requirements).
