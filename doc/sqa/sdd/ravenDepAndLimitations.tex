\subsection{Dependencies and Limitations}
The software should be designed with the fewest possible constraints.
Ideally the software should run on a wide variety of evolving hardware,
so it should follow well-adopted standards and guidelines. The software
should run on any POSIX compliant system (including Windows POSIX
emulators such as MinGW).
\\In order to be functional, \textbf{\textit{LOGOS}} depends on the
following software/libraries.
Dependencies for LOGOS as stand-alone software:
\begin{itemize}
  \item numpy
  \item scikit-learn
  \item pandas
  \item python-3
  \item pyomo
  \item coincbc
  \item glpk
  \item ipopt
\end{itemize}

Dependencies for LOGOS as RAVEN plugin:
\begin{itemize}
  \item RAVEN (raven.inl.gov) and all its dependencies (listed in ``RAVEN Software Design
    Description'' - SDD-513)
  \item pyomo
  \item coincbc
  \item glpk
  \item ipopt
\end{itemize}

\section{Definitions and Acronyms}

\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Baseline.} A specification or product (e.g., project plan, maintenance and operations [M\&O] plan, requirements, or
design) that has been formally reviewed and agreed upon, that thereafter serves as the basis for use and further
development, and that can be changed only by using an approved change control process. [ASME NQA-1-2008 with the
NQA-1a-2009 addenda edited]
  \item \textbf{Validation.} Confirmation, through the provision of objective evidence (e.g., acceptance test), that the requirements
for a specific intended use or application have been fulfilled. [ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010(E) edited]
  \item \textbf{Verification.}
  \begin{itemize}
     \item The process of evaluating a system or component to determine whether the products of a given development
     phase satisfy the conditions imposed at the start of that phase.
     \item  Formal proof of program correctness (e.g., requirements, design, implementation reviews, system tests).
     [ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010(E) edited]
