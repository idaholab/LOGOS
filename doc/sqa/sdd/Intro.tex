\section{Introduction}
\subsection{System Purpose}
\textbf{\textit{LOGOS}} is a stand-alone software package that contains a set of discrete
optimization models employable for capital budgeting optimization
problems, and \textbf{\textit{LOGOS}} integrates economic and reliability risk into a single
analysis framework. More specifically,  given system, structure and component
(SSC) health (e.g., failure rate or probability), O\&M costs, replacement costs, and cost
associated with component failure and budget constraints, \textbf{\textit{LOGOS}} provides the optimal set
of projects (e.g., SSC replacement) to maximize profit and satisfy the provided requirements.
The aforementioned input data can be either deterministic or stochastic in nature
(i.e., they can be point values or probability distribution functions). In the latter case,
several scenarios are generated by sampling the provided distributions.

\textbf{\textit{LOGOS}} can be also used as RAVEN plugin that has been developed to be linked
to RAVEN at run-time, using RAVEN APIs to perform parametric studies and plants
asset management optimizations.

\subsection{System Scope}

The \textbf{\textit{LOGOS}} plug-inâ€™s scope is to provide computational capabilities
to optimize plant resources such as maintenance optimization (ER application)
and optimal component replacement schedule (AM application) by using state-of-the-art
discrete optimization methods. The main functionalities include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Deterministic capital budgeting
  \item Prioritizing project selection to hedge against uncertainty
  \item Distributionally robust optimization
  \item Risk-based stochastic capital budgeting using conditional Value-at-Risk
  \item Plugin for the RAVEN code
  \item SSC cashflow and NPV models
\end{itemize}

As a stand-alone software, \textbf{\textit{LOGOS}} is providing a set of computational tools that can be
employed for Asset Management (AM) and Equipment Reliability (ER) applications.
These tools integrate economic and reliability risk in a single analysis framework.
Provided SSC health (e.g., failure rate or failure probability), O\&M costs,
replacement costs, cost associated to component failure and budget constraints,
these methods provide the optimal set of projects (e.g., SSC replacement) that
maximizes profit and satisfies the provided requirements. The main objective of
\textbf{\textit{LOGOS}} is to assist the engineer/user to perform:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Deterministic capital budgeting optimization;
  \item Stochastic capital budgeting optimization (i.e. scenarios-based optimization);
  \item Distributionally robust optimization on capital budgeting;
  \item Stochastic conditional Value-at-Risk based optimization on capital budgeting;
\end{itemize}

As a RAVEN plugin, \textbf{\textit{LOGOS}} (in conjunction with the RAVEN software)
is to assist the engineer/user to perform:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Holistic risk-informed plants asset management optimization
  \item Holistic risk-informed plants health management optimization
\end{itemize}

\subsection{User Characteristics}

The users of the \textbf{\textit{LOGOS}} plug-in are expected to be part of any of the
following categories:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Core developers (LOGOS core team)}: These are the developers of the
    \textbf{\textit{LOGOS}}  plug-in. They will be responsible for following
    and enforcing the appropriate software development standards. They will be
    responsible for designing, implementing and
    maintaining the plug-in.
  \item \textbf{External developers}: A Scientist or Engineer that utilizes the
    \textbf{\textit{LOGOS}}  plug-in and wants to extend its
    capabilities.This user will typically have a background in modeling and
    simulation techniques and/or numerical and economic analysis but may only have
    a limited skill-set when it comes to object-oriented
    coding, C++/Python languages.
  \item \textbf{Analysts}:  These are users that will run the software or plug-in
    (in conjunction with RAVEN) and perform various analysis on the
    simulations they perform. These users may interact with developers of the system
    requesting new features and reporting bugs found
    and will typically make heavy use of the input file format.
