\section{Overview of Modeling Components}
\label{sec:ModelingComponents}

We consider a capital budgeting problem for a nuclear generation station, with possible
extension to a larger fleet of plants. 
Due to limited resources, we can only select a
subset from a number of candidate investment projects. 
Our goal is to maximize overall net
present value (NPV), or a variant of this objective, when we incorporate uncertainty into
project cost and revenue streams. 
In doing so, we must respect resource limits
and capture key structural and stochastic dependencies of the system. 
Example projects include upgrading a steam turbine, refurbishing or replacing a set of reactor coolant pumps,
and replacing a set of feed-water heaters. 
Selecting an individual project has multiple facets and implications.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Rewards or Net Present Values}: Selecting a project can improve revenue (e.g.,
  upgrading a steam turbine may lead to an uprate in plant capacity resulting in larger
  revenue from selling power.) Replacing a key system component can improve reliability,
  increasing revenue due to a reduction in forced outages as well as operations and
  maintenance (O\&M) costs. Choosing to perform minimum maintenance versus refurbishing
  a component or replacing and improving a system can produce reward streams that
  can be negative or positive depending on the selection. Parameter
  \xmlNode{net\_present\_values} is used to specify the rewards (see Section~\ref{subsec:Parameters}).

  \item \textbf{Resources and Liabilities}: Critical resources, including (i) capital costs,
  (ii) O\&M costs, (iii) time and labor-hours during a planned outage, and (iv) personnel,
  installation and maintenance of equipment, workspaces, etc.. Within these categories, resources
  can further sub-categorized, (witch each subcategory having its own budget), according to the plant’s organizational
  structure to provide multiple “colors” of money within capital costs, O\&M costs,
  personnel availability, etc.. The set \xmlNode{resources} and parameter
  \xmlNode{available\_capitals} are used to specify the resources and
  liabilities (see Section~\ref{subsec:Sets} and Section~\ref{subsec:Parameters}).

  \item \textbf{Costs}: Selecting a project in year $t$ induces multiple
  cost streams in year $t$ as well as in subsequent years; we interpret “cost” broadly to
  include commitment of critical resources. The parameter \xmlNode{costs} is used to specify
  the costs (see Section~\ref{subsec:Parameters}).

  \item \textbf{Time Periods}: Multiple capital projects can compete for same time period,
  limiting project selection. The set \xmlNode{time\_periods} is used to provide indices for
  \textbf{costs} and \textbf{available capitals} (see Section~\ref{subsec:Sets}).

  \item \textbf{Options}: The goal of selecting a project is typically to improve or maintain
  a particular function the plant performs, and there may be multiple ways to carry out
  the task. A project may be performed over a three-year period--say, years `$t$, $t+1$, $t+2$'--or the
  start of the project could instead be two years hence, changing the equation to
  `$t+2$, $t+3$, $t+4$'. Alternatively, at increased cost and benefit, it may be
  possible to complete the project in two years: `$t$, $t+1$' or `$t+2$, $t+3$'. When selecting a project
  to uprate plant capacity, we may have the options of increasing it by 3\% or 6\%.
  In all these cases, we can perform the project in, at most, one particular way, out of a collection of
  options. We represent this by cloning a “project” into multiple project-option pairs,
  and adding a constraint saying that we can select, at most, one from this set of options.
  The set \xmlNode{options} is used to provided indices for these multiple project-option pairs
  (see Section~\ref{subsec:Sets}).

  \item \textbf{Capitals}: If we consider maintenance for multiple units in an NPP in parallel,
  it has to be decided whether to accept a particular replacement and, in the positive
  case in which unit to conduct the corresponding replacement. In this case, the set \xmlNode{capitals}
  is used to provided indices for these units (see Section~\ref{subsec:Sets}).

  \item \textbf{Available Capitals}: This is available budgets for resources/units. The parameter
  \xmlNode{available\_capitals} is used to specify the available capitals for different
  resources/units at different $t$ (see Section~\ref{subsec:Parameters}).

  \item \textbf{Non-Selection}: Not selecting a project also has implications, inducing a growth
  in O\&M costs in future years, a decrease in plant production, an increase in forced outages,
  and even risking a premature end to plant life. Thus, not selecting a project can be seen as
  one more “option” for how a larger project is executed, expanding the list discussed earlier.
  Selection is of the “do nothing” option is reflected in both liability streams and reward
  streams. This can be activated by setting \xmlNode{nonSelection} to \xmlString{True}
  (see Section~\ref{subsec:Settings}).

  \item \textbf{Uncertainty}: One limitation of traditional optimization models for capital
  budgeting is that they do not account for uncertainty in reward and cost streams associated
  with individual projects, nor do they account for uncertainty in resource availability in
  future years. Projects can incur cost over-runs, especially when projects are large, performed
  infrequently, or when there is uncertainty regarding technical viability, external contractors,
  and/or suppliers of requisite parts and materials. Occasionally, projects are performed ahead
  of schedule and with savings in cost. Planned budgets for capital improvements can be cut, and key
  personnel may be lost. Or, there may be surprise budgetary windfalls for maintenance activities
  due to decreased costs for “unplanned” maintenance. The XML node \xmlNode{Uncertainties} is used
  to specify such uncertainties (see Section~\ref{subsec:Uncertainties}).

  %\item \textbf{Synergies}: Selecting a project may require replacing a structure, system, or
  %component (SSC) during a planned outage of the plant. Depending on the physical location of
  %an SSC in the plant and its relationship to other components, selecting one project may
  %reduce the cost of selecting another project (e.g., time or know-how required to implement
  %the project) if they are selected at the same time or close in proximity. For example, if
  %a plant has two units, selecting a project for one unit in a spring outage (e.g., replacement
  %of a condensate cooler and a set of feed-water heaters) may be followed by the same activity
  %in the fall outage in the second unit, at reduced cost.

  %\item \textbf{Planned Outage}: Nuclear power plants have planned outages at regular
  %intervals (e.g., every 18 months) often in the fall and spring to be well-prepared for winter
  %and summer peaks in load. While refueling only takes a fraction of a two-month (say) period
  %without power production, maintenance projects may be deferred until an outage. Moreover,
  %an outage can provide the only possible time period in which to carry out certain types of
  %projects. Because of lost revenue, an operator seeks to limit downtime. As a result, this
  %provides a special type of resource constraint limiting project selection due to multiple
  %projects competing for time, space, personnel, and equipment during an outage.

\end{itemize}

LOGOS consists of a collection of modeling entities/components that define different
aspects of the model, including \xmlNode{Sets}, \xmlNode{Parameters},
\xmlNode{Uncertainties}, and \xmlNode{ExternalConstraints}. 
In addition, the \xmlNode{Setting} block specifies how the overall computation should run.

\subsection{Uncertainties}
\label{subsec:Uncertainties}
This subsection contains information regarding the XML nodes used to define the
\xmlNode{Uncertainties} of the optimization model being performed through LOGOS:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{available\_capitals}, \xmlDesc{optional}, specifies the scenarios

  \end{itemize}

  \item \xmlNode{net\_present\_values}, \xmlDesc{optional}, specifies the scenarios
  associated with net\_present\_values. This node accepts the attribute \xmlAttr{index}, which

    of scenarios multiplied by the length of this parameter, as defined in \xmlNode{Parameters}.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The overall number of scenarios is the total number of scenarios for \xmlNode{available\_capitals}

\subsection{External Constraints}
\label{subsec:ExternalConstraints}

This subsection contains information regarding the XML nodes used to define the
\xmlNode{ExternalConstraints} of the optimization model being performed through LOGOS.
This node accepts the following sub-node(s):
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{constraint}, \xmlDesc{string, required}, specifies the external Python
  module file name along with its absolute or relative path. This external Python
  module contains the user-defined additional constraint.
  \nb If a relative path is specified, the code first checks relative to the working directory,
  then it checks with respect to the location of the input file. The working directory can be
  specified in \xmlNode{Settings} (see Section~\ref{subsec:Settings}). In addition, the extension
  `.py' is optional for the module file name that was inputted in this node.
  This sub-node also requires the following attribute:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \xmlAttr{name}, \xmlDesc{string, required}, specifies the name of the constraint that will
    be added to the optimization problem.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Example XML:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
<ExternalConstraints>
  <constraint name="con_I">externalConst</constraint>
  <constraint name="con_II">externalConstII.py</constraint>
</ExternalConstraints>
\end{lstlisting}

These constraints are Python modules, with a format automatically interpretable by
LOGOS. For example, users can define their own constraint, and the code will be embedded
and use the constraint as though it were an active part of the code itself.
The following provides an example of a user-defined external constraint:

Example Python Function:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=python]

import pyomo.environ as pyomo

\subsection{Settings: Options for Optimization}
\label{subsec:Settings}

This subsection contains information regarding the XML nodes used to define the
\xmlNode{Settings} of the optimization model being performed through LOGOS:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \xmlNode{problem\_type}, \xmlDesc{string, required parameter}, specifies the type of
  optimization problem. Available types include \xmlString{SingleKnapsack},
  \xmlString{MultipleKnapsack}, and \xmlString{MCKP} for risk-informed stochastic optimization.
  Available types include \xmlString{droskp}, \xmlString{dromkp}, and \xmlString{dromckp}
  for distributionally robust optimization. Available types include \xmlString{cvarskp},

  \item \xmlNode{consistentConstraintII}, \xmlDesc{string, optional parameter}, indicates whether
  this constraint is enabled or not.
  \default{False}
  \item \xmlNode{solverOptions}, \xmlDesc{optional parameter}, accepts
  different options for the given solver provided in \xmlNode{solver}. A simple XML node only containing
  node tags and node texts can be used to provide the options for the solver. For example:
  \begin{lstlisting}[style=XML]
    <solverOptions>
      <threads>1</threads>
      <StochSolver>EF</StochSolver>
    </solverOptions>
  \end{lstlisting}
  In addition, if the problem type is distributionally robust optimization, additional option
  \xmlNode{radius\_ambiguity} can be used to control the Wasserstein distance. See Section~\ref{sec:DROCapitalBudgeting}.
  If the problem type is conditional value at risk (See Section~\ref{sec:CVaR}), additional options are available:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \xmlNode{risk\_aversion}, \xmlDesc{float within $[0,1]$, optional parameter}, indicates the weight on
    maximizing expected NPV versus penalizing solutions that yield low-NPV scenarios.
    \item \xmlNode{confidence\_level}, \xmlDesc{float within $[0,1]$, optional parameter},  indicates
    the confidence level, i.e. the $\alpha$-percentile of the loss.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
