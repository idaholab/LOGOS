<!--
  For the multi-knapsack with regulatory mandated projects, 20 combined scenarios between 'available_capitals' and
  'net_present_values'. Priority List will be: 1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 2, 8, 5, 9, 4, 6, 3, 7 with
  expected NPV 2.589. In this case, items 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 are regulatory mandated items
