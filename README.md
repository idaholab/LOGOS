# Logos: Operation Optimization Toolkit

LOGOS is a software package which contains a set of discrete optimization models
that can be employed for capital budgeting optimization problems. More specifically,
provided a set of items (characterized by cost and reward values) and constraints,
these models select the best combination of items which maximizes overall reward
and satisfies the provided constraints. The developed models are based on different
versions of the knapsack optimization algorithms. Two main classes of optimization
models have been initially developed: deterministic and stochastic. Stochastic
optimization models evolve deterministic models by explicitly considering data
uncertainties (associated to constraints or item cost and reward). These models
can be employed as stand-alone models or interfaced with the INL developed RAVEN
code to propagate data uncertainties and analyze the generated data
(i.e., sensitivity analysis).
